Pandas

python pandas script to read an excel sheet having 2 columns id and name

pip install pandas openpyxl

import pandas as pd

# Define the path to the Excel file
file_path = 'your_file.xlsx'

# Read the Excel file into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_excel(file_path)

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(df.head())

Explanation:
file_path is the location of your Excel file. Replace 'your_file.xlsx' with the path to your file.
pd.read_excel(file_path) reads the Excel file into a pandas DataFrame.
df.head() will display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame, so you can inspect the data.


Make sure your Excel file has columns labeled id and name. If the column names are different, you can specify them using the names parameter like this:
df = pd.read_excel(file_path, names=['id', 'name'])

This will ensure the columns are named id and name, regardless of how they appear in the file.
