2) Creating new account,The protocol which google use(HTTP).

3) Git commands ->

	i) git clone (To cloning the items from remote to local repo).
	ii) git config --global user.name " " && git config --global user.email " " (If the system asks for verification).
	iii) git pull (It pulls the file or anything from the repo in cloud/remote to the desktop/local).
	iv) git add (to add everything) /git add .(for current directory) -> To track the files or folders and they are ready to commit.
	v) git commit -m " " -> to commit them and they are ready to be pushed.(Mainly it will convert the file into object).Git converts the files into objects (blobs) and stores them in the Git database .
	vi) git push (Though before pushing it pulls implicitly to ensure that updates are in syncs and this pushes the files which are in track to the remote repo).
	vii) U cant push empty directory as it wont track.Only tracks files and their content.
Creating one more sub file in the folder you need to enter the folder and then use (/)(backward slash).
And the "main" is like the parent node like u can create how many branches u want but main is just one.

4) And basically creating a PAN ( Personal Access Token ) which is like a two factor autentication and improved security.
