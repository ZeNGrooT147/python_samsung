LIST:

1. List is a DS where all its elements are stored in continuous memory locations
2. The elements of the list can be of different DTs. A element of a list can be a list itself.
3. However, it is good practice to have list of elements of same DT.
4. A list is mutable. Thus we can add and delete elements to/from a list.
5. List can have duplicate elements.
6. List is Ordered. That is, we can access list elements using index.
7. List is a class. Thus we have lot of properties which can be applied on a list.
