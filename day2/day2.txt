DAY 2 (10/12/2024)

OPERATORS IN PYTHON:

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:
+ - / // * % **

All are binary operators (Need 2 operands)
I/P are numbers
O/P is also a number
In the expresssion 10 + 5 - 12, addition is performed 1st.
Hence arithmetic operators have Left to Right Associtivity, except the power operator.
That is, 10 + 5 + 15 = 15 + 15 = 30
2 ** 3 ** 2 = 2 ** 9 = 512
The operator ** has the highest priority/precdence
Precedence of operators:
**
* / // %
+ -

Relational Operators:
> < >= <= != ==
All are Binary operators.
I/P are numbers
O/P is truth value (boolean)
They have lesser precedence than arithmetic operators, but higher than logical operators.

What ever we do using >= and <= can be done using > and < respectively.
For example:
age >= 20 and age <= 80
is same as:
age > 19 and age < 81

[10, 20] Closed Interval
The range includes the end values
num >= 10 and num <= 20

(30, 50) Open Interval
The range is 31 to 49 because it doesn't include the end values
num > 30 and num < 50

[20, 40) Right Open
The range is 20 to 39
num >= 20 and num < 40

A student can enroll into the course if her age is between 18 and 60
student_age >= 18 and student_age <= 60
This is more readable

student_age > 17 and student_age < 61
This is less readable
---------------------------------------------
LOGICAL OPERATORS:
and or not (Strictly Short Circuiting)

I/P are boolean
O/P is boolean
not operator is unary (We prefix the not before the value)
and or are binary operators
Left to Right Associtivity
In the expresssion: op1 and op2 or op3
op1 and op2 is performed 1st
The o/p of a condition is always passed as i/p to the logical operators.
